    <h1>Preventing Counterfeit Drugs</h1>
    <div class="about-section">
      <h2>About Counterfeit Drugs</h2>
      <p>
        Counterfeit drugs are fake or substandard medications that pose serious risks to public health. They may contain incorrect ingredients, improper dosages, or no active ingredients at all. These drugs can lead to treatment failure, drug resistance, and even death. Counterfeit drugs are a global problem, affecting both developed and developing countries.
      </p>
      <div class="highlight">
        <p>
          <strong>Did you know?</strong> According to the World Health Organization (WHO), around 10% of medicines in low- and middle-income countries are counterfeit. In some regions, this number can be as high as 30%.
        </p>
      </div>
      <h2>How to Prevent Counterfeit Drugs</h2>
      <p>
        Preventing counterfeit drugs requires a combination of regulatory measures, public awareness, and technological solutions. Here are some key steps:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Purchase medications only from licensed pharmacies:</strong> Always buy medicines from reputable sources, whether online or in-person. Avoid unverified sellers or websites offering suspiciously low prices.</li>
        <li><strong>Verify the authenticity of drugs:</strong> Many pharmaceutical companies now include serial numbers, QR codes, or holograms on their packaging. Use these features to confirm the legitimacy of the product.</li>
        <li><strong>Report suspicious medications:</strong> If you suspect that a drug is counterfeit, report it to your local regulatory authority or health organization. Your action could save lives.</li>
        <li><strong>Support global efforts:</strong> Advocate for stronger regulations and international cooperation to combat counterfeit drugs.</li>
      </ul>

        <h2>Technological Solutions</h2>
        <p>
          Advanced technologies are playing a crucial role in combating counterfeit drugs. Here are some innovative solutions:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Blockchain:</strong> Blockchain technology is being used to create tamper-proof records of a drug's journey through the supply chain. This ensures transparency and traceability.</li>
          <li><strong>RFID Tags:</strong> Radio-frequency identification (RFID) tags are embedded in drug packaging to track and verify authenticity at every stage of distribution.</li>

          <li><strong>Mobile Apps:</strong> Some organizations have developed apps that allow consumers to scan QR codes on drug packaging to verify authenticity instantly.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Global Initiatives</h2>
        <p>
          International organizations and governments are working together to address the issue of counterfeit drugs. Key initiatives include:
        </p>
